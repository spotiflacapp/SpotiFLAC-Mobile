## Extensions

Extensions let the community add new music sources and features without waiting for app updates. When a streaming service API changes or a new source becomes available, extensions can be updated independently.

### Installing Extensions

1. Open the **Store** tab in the app
2. On first launch, enter an **Extension Repository URL** when prompted
3. Browse and install extensions with one tap
4. Or download a `.spotiflac-ext` file and install manually via **Settings > Extensions**
5. Configure extension settings if needed
6. Set provider priority under **Settings > Extensions > Provider Priority**

### Developing Extensions

> [!NOTE]
> Want to build your own extension? The [Extension Development Guide](https://spotiflac.zarz.moe/docs) has everything you need.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Why does the Store tab ask me to enter a URL?</b></summary>
<br>

Starting from version 3.8.0, SpotiFLAC uses a decentralized extension repository system extensions are hosted on GitHub repositories rather than a built-in server, so anyone can create and host their own. Enter a repository URL in the Store tab to browse and install extensions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why is my download failing with "Song not found"?</b></summary>
<br>

The track may not be available on the streaming services. Try enabling more providers under **Settings > Download > Provider Priority**, or install additional extensions like Amazon Music from the Store.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why are some tracks downloading in lower quality?</b></summary>
<br>

Quality depends on what's available from the streaming service and its extensions. Built-in providers:
- **Tidal** up to 24-bit/192kHz
- **Qobuz** up to 24-bit/192kHz
- **Deezer** up to 16-bit/44.1kHz

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I download playlists?</b></summary>
<br>

Yes! Just paste the playlist URL in the search bar. The app will fetch all tracks and queue them for download.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why do I need to grant storage permission?</b></summary>
<br>

The app needs permission to save downloaded files to your device. On Android 13+, you may need to grant **All files access** under **Settings > Apps > SpotiFLAC > Permissions**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is this app safe?</b></summary>
<br>

Yes SpotiFLAC is open source and you can verify the code yourself. Each release is also scanned with VirusTotal (see badge above).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why is downloading not working in my country?</b></summary>
<br>

Some countries have restricted access to certain streaming service APIs. If downloads are failing, try using a VPN to connect through a different region.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I add SpotiFLAC to AltStore or SideStore?</b></summary>
<br>

Yes! Add the official source to receive updates directly within the app. Copy this link:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zarzet/SpotiFLAC-Mobile/refs/heads/main/apps.json
```

In AltStore/SideStore, go to **Browse > Sources**, tap **+**, and paste the link.
